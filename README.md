# yoloDarkflow
This repo encapsulates all you need for running YOLO(You Look Only Once) algorithm using the Tensorflow translation of Darknet, i.e. Darkflow

System specifications :
* Operating system - Ubuntu 18.04LTS / other Linux distro
* If you want to harness the potential of a graphics card in your project, then install 
    * CUDA 9 [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive] 
    * cudnn 7 [https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive]
    * Tensorflow-gpu 1.80 [sudo pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.80] 
    [Mark that some higher version of Tensorflow-gpu such as 1.14 won't support cudnn 7]
